# Advent of Code 2023 - Rust

[Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)

My goal for this Advent of Code is to get better with Rust. I've only completed the "React for TS devs" course on Frontend Masters and read a few chapters of the book, so my knowledge is very limited still. But I'm hoping AoC will prove to be a good way to learn a new language, like I've heard so many talk about.
